# UTM Shuttle Driver

This app is the driver side of the UTM shuttle bus tracker project.

In this app, drivers are able to login, select their shifts and be on their way.

Once shfts have been selected, the app will periodically send their location to the server which will 
interpret it and let the student app know if their shuttle bus is running late or not.

# Details on how to run the app with mock data

Coming soon...
